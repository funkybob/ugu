This tutorial assumes you have a recent version of Python 3 installed,
including the Python3 venv module (a separate package on Debian and some other
distros).

So let's create a directory for our work to live in. We're going to create
``/srv/www/project``. The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard proscribes
distributions from using the ``/sys`` namespace, so we know our work won't be
overwritten by package updates.
